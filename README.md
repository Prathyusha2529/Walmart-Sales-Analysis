# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

### Detailed Overview
The **Walmart Sales Analysis Project** aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of sales dynamics across multiple Walmart stores using historical data. By analyzing trends, seasonal patterns, and external factors such as holidays, weather, and economic conditions, the project seeks to uncover actionable insights for optimizing sales and inventory management. Advanced data visualization techniques highlight key relationships, while machine learning models predict future sales with accuracy. This project is designed to support business decisions by combining data science expertise with real-world retail challenges.

**Objective**
The primary goals of the project are:
1. **Understand sales patterns**: Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and seasonality.
   
2. **Predict future sales**: Use machine learning techniques to forecast sales and improve business decisions.
   
3. **Optimize inventory management**: Derive actionable insights to optimize inventory planning and stock replenishment.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains Walmart store sales data, including:
- **Store details**: Information about individual store locations.
- **Sales data**: Historical sales figures across multiple stores.
- **Promotions**: Data on promotional periods and their effects.
- **Additional features**: Weather conditions, holidays, and macroeconomic indicators.

### Key Features
1. **Date**: Date of the sales record.
2. **Store**: Unique identifier for each Walmart store.
3. **Weekly Sales**: Weekly revenue generated by each store.
4. **Holiday Flag**: Indicates whether the week includes a holiday (Boolean).
5. **Temperature**: Average temperature for the week.
6. **Fuel Price**: Weekly average fuel prices in the region.
7. **CPI**: Consumer Price Index.
8. **Unemployment**: Unemployment rate for the region.

## Tools and Libraries
The following libraries and tools were used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
